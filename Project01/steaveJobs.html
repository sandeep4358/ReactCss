              Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an
              American businessman, inventor, and investor best known for
              co-founding the technology giant Apple Inc. Jobs was also the
              founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. He
              was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and
              1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple
              co-founder Steve Wozniak.

              Jobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly
              afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing
              that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking
              enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak
              co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak's
              Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and
              wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one
              of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs
              saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was
              mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to
              the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed
              by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced
              computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop
              publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple
              LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.
